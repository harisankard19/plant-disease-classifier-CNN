# plant-disease-classifier-CNN

the plantvillage-dataset is a great dataset to get hands-on with real image data, especially if you're learning computer vision or working on plant disease detection. It’s a clean, well-labeled dataset with thousands of leaf images from different plants, both healthy and diseased. When you explore the dataset, you’ll see class names like:

Apple___Apple_scab

Apple___Black_rot

Apple___Cedar_apple_rust

Apple___healthy

Blueberry___healthy

Cherry_(including_sour)___Powdery_mildew

Each image is categorized by plant type and condition, so it's perfect for training a model to recognize different diseases. It's especially useful if you’re trying out CNNs and want something practical and structured to work with.
